# MapBack
This is a [Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) project that is to serve as an API where geographical locations and associated data can be stored. It was written by me, Lowe Wilsson.

For converting color hex codes to color names (when no custom color name is provided), the [colornames](https://github.com/rgson/python-colornames) library by [rgson](https://github.com/rgson/) is used.
